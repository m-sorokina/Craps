**Short description**  
This project implements the classic Craps dice game. The game starts with a come-out roll:  
 - rolling a 7 or 11 wins instantly.  
 - rolling 2, 3, or 12 loses instantly.
   
Any other number sets the point.  
Once a point is set, the player continues rolling:  
 - rolling the point again wins.  
 - rolling a 7 loses.
